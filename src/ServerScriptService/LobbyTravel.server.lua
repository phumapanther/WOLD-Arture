-- LobbyTravel.server.lua: the trip back to the lobby, and the things that call it off.
--
-- Pressing the menu's "back to lobby" used to save and teleport in the same breath. Nothing was wrong with
-- that except what the player saw, which was nothing: Roblox needs a few seconds to find or build a lobby
-- server and move them to it, and for all of those seconds the game looks exactly as it did before the press.
-- The button read as broken, and broken buttons get pressed again.
--
-- So the trip is now a thing that TAKES TIME on purpose, with a bar over it -- and once there is a window,
-- there is something that can happen during it. A blow landing, or going down, calls the whole thing off.
-- Leaving is not something you should be able to do while a monster is eating you.
--
-- The save still happens on the server and still happens BEFORE the teleport: PlayerRemoving does not
-- reliably fire before a teleport removes the character, which is what lost the save when the client did
-- this itself. ProfileAccess.Flush is PlayerProfile's own saveAll under another name.
