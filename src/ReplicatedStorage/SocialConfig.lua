-- Gold is NOT lost on death, pocket or banked. An earlier comment here claimed the pocket was emptied and
-- that the difference was the point of the bank, but no code ever did it -- and on the decision it stays

-- reaching people, and walking to a teller is what makes the bank a place. Transfers stay here, because
-- sending money to someone is exactly the kind of thing a communication device is for.
