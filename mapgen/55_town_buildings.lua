--
-- 50_first_town builds the pads and labels; this phase drops a model onto each one. Keeping them
-- as two phases means the layout can be re-cut without rebuilding every building, and a building
-- can be swapped for another without touching the streets.
--
-- Run with the modelkit and the model files loaded:
--   node tools/run-luau.js mapgen/55_town_buildings.lua --kit --models
--
-- Each plot part carries PlotKey; that key picks the model. A plot's CFrame already holds the
-- rotation the level design chose, so the building is set down on the pad top with the pad's own
-- facing -- the front (-Z) ends up looking at the street, as intended.
